<tr><td>0</td><td>22692606</td><td>Scaffold <b>informatics</b> and biomimetic design: three-dimensional medical reconstruction.</td><td>This chapter briefly describes the concepts underlying medical imaging reconstruction and the requirements for its integration with subsequent applications as BioCAD, rapid prototyping (RP), and rapid manufacturing (RM) of implants, scaffolds, or organs. As an introduction to the problem, principles related to data acquisition, enhancement, segmentation, and interpolation are discussed. After this, some available three-dimensional medical reconstruction software tools are presented. Finally, applications of these technologies are illustrated.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>26138570</td><td>Chemoinformatics approach for building molecular networks from marine organisms.</td><td>Natural products obtained from marine sources are considered to be a rich and diverse source of potential drugs. In the present work we demonstrate the use of chemo <b>informatics</b> approach for the design of new molecules inspired by molecules from marine organisms. Accordingly we have assimilated information from two major scientific domains namely chemoinformatics and biodiversity <b>informatics</b> to develop an interactive marine database named MIMMO (Medicinally Important Molecules from Marine Organisms). The database can be queried for species, molecules, scaffolds, drugs, diseases and associated cumulative biological activity spectrum along with links to the literature resources. Molecular <b>informatics</b> analysis of the molecules obtained from MIMMO was performed to study their chemical space. The distinct skeletal features of the biologically active compounds isolated from marine species were identified. Scaffold molecules and species networks were created to identify common scaffolds from marine source and drug space. An analysis of the entire molecular data revealed a unique list of around 2000 molecules from which ten most frequently occurring distinct scaffolds were obtained.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>23181765</td><td>On improving the communication between models and data.</td><td>The potential for model-data synthesis is growing in importance as we enter an era of 'big data', greater connectivity and faster computation. Realizing this potential requires that the research community broaden its perspective about how and why they interact with models. Models can be viewed as scaffolds that allow data at different scales to inform each other through our understanding of underlying processes. Perceptions of relevance, accessibility and <b>informatics</b> are presented as the primary barriers to broader adoption of models by the community, while an inability to fully utilize the breadth of expertise and data from the community is a primary barrier to model improvement. Overall, we promote a community-based paradigm to model-data synthesis and highlight some of the tools and techniques that facilitate this approach. Scientific workflows address critical <b>informatics</b> issues in transparency, repeatability and automation, while intuitive, flexible web-based interfaces make running and visualizing models more accessible. Bayesian statistics provides powerful tools for assimilating a diversity of data types and for the analysis of uncertainty. Uncertainty analyses enable new measurements to target those processes most limiting our predictive ability. Moving forward, tools for information management and data assimilation need to be improved and made more accessible.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>25486307</td><td>Targeting HIV-1 integrase with strand transfer inhibitors.</td><td>HIV-1 integrase (IN) is a retroviral enzyme essential for integration of genetic material into the DNA of the host cell and hence for viral replication. The absence of an equivalent enzyme in humans makes IN an interesting target for anti-HIV drug design. This review briefly overviews the structural and functional properties of HIV-1 IN. We analyze the binding modes of the established drugs, clinical candidates and a comprehensive library of leads based on innovative chemical scaffolds of HIV-1 IN strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). Computational clustering techniques are applied for identifying structural features relating to bioactivity. From bio- and chemo-<b>informatics</b> analyses, we provide novel insights into structure-activity relationships of INSTIs and elaborate new strategies for design of innovative inhibitors.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>14556653</td><td>Computer-aided tissue engineering: application to biomimetic modelling and design of tissue scaffolds.</td><td>Computer-aided tissue engineering (CATE) enables many novel approaches in modelling, design and fabrication of complex tissue substitutes with enhanced functionality and improved cell-matrix interactions. Central to CATE is its bio-tissue <b>informatics</b> model that represents tissue biological, biomechanical and biochemical information that serves as a central repository to interface design, simulation and tissue fabrication. The present paper discusses the application of a CATE approach to the biomimetic design of bone tissue scaffold. A general CATE-based process for biomimetic modelling, anatomic reconstruction, computer-assisted-design of tissue scaffold, quantitative-computed-tomography characterization, finite element analysis and freeform extruding deposition for fabrication of scaffold is presented.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>24083247</td><td>3D-culture system for heart regeneration and cardiac medicine.</td><td>3D cultures have gained attention in the field of regenerative medicine for their usefulness as in vitro model of solid tissues. Bottom-up technology to generate artificial tissues or organs is prospective and an attractive approach that will expand as the field of regenerative medicine becomes more translational. We have characterized c-kit positive cardiac stem cells after long-term cultures and established a 3D-nanoculture system using collagen scaffolds. By combining <b>informatics</b>-based studies, including proteomic analyses and microarrays, we sought to generate methods that modeled cardiac regeneration which can ultimately be used to build artificial hearts. Here, we describe the use of biodegradable beads or 3D cultures to study cardiac regeneration. We summarize recent work that demonstrates that, by using a combination of molecular analyses with 3D cultures, it is possible to evaluate concise mechanisms of solid tissue stem cell biology.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>26138575</td><td>Role of open source tools and resources in virtual screening for drug discovery.</td><td>Advancement in chemoinformatics research in parallel with availability of high performance computing platform has made handling of large scale multi-dimensional scientific data for high throughput drug discovery easier. In this study we have explored publicly available molecular databases with the help of open-source based integrated in-house molecular <b>informatics</b> tools for virtual screening. The virtual screening literature for past decade has been extensively investigated and thoroughly analyzed to reveal interesting patterns with respect to the drug, target, scaffold and disease space. The review also focuses on the integrated chemoinformatics tools that are capable of harvesting chemical data from textual literature information and transform them into truly computable chemical structures, identification of unique fragments and scaffolds from a class of compounds, automatic generation of focused virtual libraries, computation of molecular descriptors for structure-activity relationship studies, application of conventional filters used in lead discovery along with in-house developed exhaustive PTC (Pharmacophore, Toxicophores and Chemophores) filters and machine learning tools for the design of potential disease specific inhibitors. A case study on kinase inhibitors is provided as an example.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>23285683</td><td>Plant phenolics as drug leads -- what is missing?</td><td>Low molecular weight phenols of plant origin are undoubtedly semiochemicals although not all of them can be easily classified as typical allelochemicals, which straightforwardly benefit the releaser. We have selected and surveyed this particular class of secondary metabolites, which shares high chemical reactivity with intrinsic biocompatibility and affinity for variety of molecular targets gained through evolution, because their suitability as prospective lead compounds for medicinal chemistry seems high but relatively unexplored. In particular, plant phenolics could be perceived as a natural product library, which contains privileged scaffolds, as evidenced by examples of endogenous phenols, phytochemicals containing aryl hydroxyl groups and phenolic synthetic drugs. It is postulated that application of bio-chemo-<b>informatic</b> tools to such library can be helpful in pulling out new drug candidates as well as in validating ADMET compatibility and suitability of the old ones. After short survey of structural diversity represented by plant phenolics, we focus on the compounds which either have obvious dietary significance or rich record of pharmacological studies, or both. It can be seen that apart from growing use of phytochemicals in dietary supplements, slow progress through clinical trials towards new drug registration is observed in that category of natural products. Such waste of resources on the way of transformation from renewable materials to high techhigh value products aimed for improved human healthcare is deplorable and should be reformed in name of sustainability. We attempt to answer the question why popular plant phenolics with well established health benefits and reasonably well recognized molecular pharmacology (such as: catechins, curcumin, resveratrol, quercetin and its glycosides, genistein, silymarin) have difficulties in attaining registered drug or even IND level.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>24768714</td><td>A dual role for the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein in cancer: mitochondria versus endoplasmic reticulum.</td><td>Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 contributes to cancer formation and progression by promoting the survival of altered cells. Hence, it is a prime target for novel specific anti-cancer therapeutics. In addition to its canonical anti-apoptotic role, Bcl-2 has an inhibitory effect on cell-cycle progression. Bcl-2 acts at two different intracellular compartments, the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). At the mitochondria, Bcl-2 via its hydrophobic cleft scaffolds the Bcl-2-homology (BH) domain 3 (BH3) of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-family members. Small molecules (like BH3 mimetics) can disrupt this interaction, resulting in apoptotic cell death in cancer cells. At the ER, Bcl-2 modulates Ca(2+) signaling, thereby promoting proliferation while increasing resistance to apoptosis. Bcl-2 at the ER acts via its N-terminal BH4 domain, which directly binds and inhibits the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), the main intracellular Ca(2+)-release channel. Tools targeting the BH4 domain of Bcl-2 reverse Bcl-2's inhibitory action on IP3Rs and trigger pro-apoptotic Ca(2+) signaling in cancer B-cells, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells. The sensitivity of DLBCL cells to BH4-domain targeting tools strongly correlated with the expression levels of the IP3R2 channel, the IP3R isoform with the highest affinity for IP3. Interestingly, bio-<b>informatic</b> analysis of a database of primary CLL patient cells also revealed a transcriptional upregulation of IP3R2. Finally, this review proposes a model, in which cancer cell survival depends on Bcl-2 at the mitochondria andor the ER. This dependence likely will have an impact on their responses to BH3-mimetic drugs and BH4-domain targeting tools.
