			<text>Pathogenesis of proliferative neovascular retinopathies and the role of vitrectomy. A hypothesis.</text>
		</passage>

			<offset>97</offset>
			<text>Proliferative neovascular retinopathies may be caused by the release of a hypothetical vasoproliferative factor, but mechanical factors seem to self-perpetuate the disease as well. Contraction of proliferative tissue causes vitreous detachment and traction on the retina. Congestion of vascular fronds by traction further stimulates vascularization. Traction on vessels results in hemorrhages. Surgical removal of all intravitreal scaffolds by vitrectomy seems to eliminate the development of this vicious cycle. Results of vitreous surgery seem to indicate that the hypothesis of scaffold removal is valid.</text>

			<text>Isolation of a protein scaffold from mitotic HeLa cell chromosomes.</text>
		</passage>
		<passage>
			<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
			<offset>67</offset>
			<text>We have recently shown that, after the histones and most of the nonhistone proteins are gently removed from HeLa metaphase chromosomes, the chromosomal DNA is still highly organized and relatively compact. The structure of these histone-depleted chromosomes is due to the presence of a number of nonhistone proteins that form a central scaffold that retains the approximate size and shape of intact chromosomes and to which the DNA is attached, predominantly forming loops. We now demonstrate that the protein scaffold may be isolated independently of the DNA by treating HeLa chromosomes with micrococcal nuclease before removing the histones.The chromosomal scaffolds may be isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation as a well-defined peak that is stable in 2 M sodium chloride, but is dissociated by treatment with proteases, 4 M urea, or 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveals that the protein content of scaffold preparations is identical to that of histone-depleted chromosomes. Fluorescence microscopy of purified scaffolds in isolation buffer shows that the particles still possess the familiar chromosome morphology. When the scaffolds are examined in the electron microscope, a fibrous structure with the approximate size and shape of intact, paired chromatids is seen. Less than 0.1% of the chromosomal DNA and virtually no histones are associated with the purified scaffold structures.</text>

			<text>Fluorescent localization of membrane sites in glycerinated chicken skeletal muscle fibers and the relationship of these sites to the protein composition of the Z disc.</text>
		</passage>
		<passage>
			<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
			<offset>167</offset>
			<text>Didansyl derivatives of amino acids and N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine were used to localize membrane hydrophobic sites in glycerol-extracted chicken skeletal muscle fibers. Epifluorescence microscopy revealed that such sites coincide with the distribution of mitochondria, the transverse tubular (T) system and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). They are specifically associated with myofibril Z lines and occasionally extend from one Z plane to the next longitudinally along the muscle fiber. The hydrophobic probes interact noncovalently with the Z lines, and their induced fluorescence can be eliminated by exposure of the myofibrils to ionic detergents, nonionic detergents, or phospholipase C, before or after addition of the hydrophobic label. Extraction of glycerinated fibers with 0.6 M KI removes the majority of sarcomeric actin and myosin and leaves a scaffold of longitudinally interconnected Z planes. Membrane fluorescence remains tightly associated with these Z planes and with the remnant mitochondria. Shearing of such scaffolds results in the cleavage of the longitudinal connections and the production of large sheets of interconnected, close-packed Z discs in a honeycomb-like array. Comparison of the localization of two Z disc proteins, desmin and alpha-actinin, with that of the membrane material reveals that alpha-actinin is localized in the interior of each myofibril Z disc whereas both desmin and the membrane material surround each disc. Thus, glycerination and KI extraction of muscle fibers leaves remnants of T system and SR membranes tightly associated with the Z disc honeycomb lattice. Because the Z discs are connected at their peripheries through the T system appear to the plasma membrane, desmin and this membrane structure appear to be connected throughout the whole Z plane up to and including the plasma membrane. The congruent localization of desmin and the T system strongly suggests that this molecule mediates the adhesion of this membrane system around each Z disc.</text>

			<offset>56</offset>
			<text>Antiserum has been raised to a chromosomal protein fraction specific for Hela cells. The immunoactivity is located in the transcriptionally inactive regions of log phase chromatin. Digestion of metaphase chromosomes results in the purification of the immunoactivity in the scaffold region of the chromosomes. Extensive nuclease digestion of the scaffolds results in loss of activity. The data suggest that some of the proteins in the scaffold area are both tight binding and cell specific and may therefore play a sophisticated role in gene expression.</text>

			<text>Modeling the antigen combining site of an anti-dinitrophenyl antibody, ANO2.</text>
		</passage>
		<passage>
			<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
			<offset>76</offset>
			<text>A model structure has been constructed for a monoclonal anti-dinitrophenyl antibody. The antibody, ANO2, has been sequenced and cloned (Anglister, J., Frey, T., &amp; McConnell, H.M., 1984, Biochemistry 23, 1138-1142). Its amino acid sequence shows striking homology with the anti-lysozyme Fab fragments HyHel5 (83%) and HyHel10 (73%). Based on this homology, a model for the ANO2 variable heavy and variable light chain framework was constructed using a hybrid of the HyHel5 light chain and the HyHel10 heavy chain backbone, omitting the hypervariable loops. These coordinates were used as scaffolds for the model building of ANO2. The CONGEN conformational sampling algorithm (Bruccoleri, R.E. &amp; Karplus, M., 1987, Biopolymers 26, 127-196) was used to model the six hypervariable loops that contain the antigen-combining site. All the possible conformations of the loop backbones were constructed and the best loop structures were selected using a combination of the CHARMM potential energy function and evaluation of the solvent-accessible surface area of the conformers. The order in which the loops were searched was carried out based on the relative locations of the loops with reference to the framework of the beta-barrel, namely, L2-H1-L3-H2-H3-L1. The model structures thus obtained were compared to the high resolution X-ray structure (Brünger, A.T., Leahy, D.J., Hynes, T.R., &amp; Fox, R.O., 1991, J. Mol. Biol. 221, 239-256).</text>

			<text>Myosin heavy chain composition of single fibres and their origins and distribution in developing fascicles of sheep tibialis cranialis muscles.</text>
		</passage>
		<passage>
			<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
			<offset>143</offset>
			<text>The myosin heavy chain (MHC) composition of single muscle fibres in developing sheep tibialis cranialis muscles was examined immunohistochemically with monoclonal antibodies to MHC isozymes. Data were collected with conventional microscopy and computerized image analysis from embryonic day (E) 76 to postnatal day (PN) 20, and from adult animals. At E76, 23% of the young myofibres stained for slow-twitch MHC. The number of these fibres considerably exceeded the number of primary and secondary myotubes. By E100, smaller fibres, negative for slow-twitch MHC, encircled each fibre from the initial population to form rosettes. A second population of small fibres appeared in the unoccupied spaces between rosettes. Small fibres, whether belonging to rosettes or not, did not initially express slow-twitch MHC, expressing mainly neonatal myosin instead. These small fibres then diverged into three separate groups. In the first group most fibres transiently expressed adult fast myosin (maximal at E110-E120), but in the adult expressed slow myosin. This transformation to the slow MHC phenotype commenced at E110, was nearing completion by 20 postnatal days, and was responsible for approximately 60% of the adult slow twitch fibre population. In the other two groups expression of adult fast MHC was maintained, and in the adult they accounted for 14% (IIa MHC) and 17% (IIb MHC) of the total fibre numbers. We conclude that muscle fibre formation in this large muscle involves at least three generations of myotube. Secondary myotubes are generated on a framework of primary myotubes and both populations differentiate into the young myofibres which we observed at E76 to form rosettes. Tertiary myotubes, in turn, appear in the spaces between rosettes and along the borders of fascicles, using the outer fibres of rosettes as scaffolds.</text>

			<text>Characterization of a plant scaffold attachment region in a DNA fragment that normalizes transgene expression in tobacco.</text>
		</passage>
		<passage>
			<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
			<offset>121</offset>
			<text>Using a low-salt extraction procedure, we isolated nuclear scaffolds from tobacco that bind specific plant DNA fragments in vitro. One of these fragments was characterized in more detail; this characterization showed that it contains sequences with structural properties analogous to animal scaffold attachment regions (SARs). We showed that scaffold attachment is evolutionarily conserved between plants and animals, although different SARs have different binding affinities. Furthermore, we demonstrated that flanking a chimeric transgene with the characterized SAR-containing fragment reduces significantly the variation in expression in series of transformants with an active insertion, whereas a SAR fragment from the human beta-globin locus does not. Moreover, the frequency distribution patterns of transgene activities showed that most of the transformants containing the plant SAR fragment had expression levels clustered around the mean. These data suggest that the particular plant DNA fragment can insulate the reporter gene from expression-influencing effects exerted from the host chromatin.</text>

			<text>Behavior of axons, Schwann cells and perineurial cells in nerve regeneration within transplanted nerve grafts: effects of anti-laminin and anti-fibronectin antisera.</text>
		</passage>
		<passage>
			<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
			<offset>165</offset>
			<text>Wistar rats (close cloned strain) were used to investigate the effect of endogenous laminin and fibronectin on axons, Schwann cells and perineurial cells in the regenerating peripheral nervous system (PNS). Sciatic nerve grafts obtained from donor rats were frozen, thawed and treated with rabbit anti-rat laminin or anti-fibronectin antiserum. Control grafts were treated with normal rabbit serum alone. One cm long portions of the sciatic nerve of the recipient rats were replaced with grafts. At 15 days after transplantation the number of regenerated axons in the laminin- and fibronectin-depleted grafts was half of that in the control. The growing axons in the laminin-depleted grafts did not recognize the basal lamina scaffolds (BLS) remaining in the basal lamina tubes, while in the control and fibronectin-depleted grafts 90% or more of axons grew inside the BLS. Elongation of axons always preceded migration of Schwann cells with the latter subsequently adhering to and wrapping around the former. Perineurium-forming fibroblastic cells recognized the combination of axons and Schwann cells and formed perineurial fasciculi around them. These fibroblastic cells did not recognize empty BLS but responded to them only when fibronectin was depleted. Macrophages sometimes closely faced the naked axons which elongated outside the BLS. These results suggest that in the early stages of nerve regeneration endogenous laminin and fibronectin not only regulate the growth of regenerating nerve fibers, but also exert a positive influence on perineurial cells and macrophages, both of which play important roles in nerve tissue injury and repair.</text>

			<text>Meniscal regeneration with copolymeric collagen scaffolds. In vitro and in vivo studies evaluated clinically, histologically, and biochemically.</text>

			<offset>144</offset>
			<text>We sought to create a regeneration template for the meniscal cartilage of the knee to induce complete meniscal regeneration, and to develop the technique for implanting the prosthetic appliance in vivo. We designed a resorbable collagen-based scaffold and conducted in vitro and in vivo studies. In vivo, the scaffold was implanted in the knees of immature swine and mature canines and evaluated clinically, histologically, and biochemically. Because the canine stifle joint meniscus is more clinically relevant to the human meniscus, this paper emphasizes those results. We studied 24 mixed breed dogs (14 males and 10 females) with an average weight of 25.5 kg (range, 20 to 35) that were obtained from a USDA-licensed supplier. The dogs were deemed clinically and radiographically skeletally mature. None of the dogs had a preexisting knee joint abnormality. All dogs underwent an 80% subtotal resection of the medial meniscus bilaterally. A collagen template was implanted in one stifle (N = 24). The contralateral side served as a control: 12 dogs had a total resection alone and the other 12 dogs had an immediate replantation of the autologous meniscus. Results were tabulated at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. At final evaluation, before the animals were euthanized, the results were submitted for statistical analysis as well as histologic and biochemical analyses. The results demonstrated that a copolymeric collagen-based scaffold can be constructed that is compatible with meniscal fibrochondrocyte growth in vitro and in vivo, that does not inhibit meniscal regeneration in an immature pig, and that may induce regeneration of the meniscus in the mature dog.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</text>

			<text>Morphometric analysis of the developing, murine aneural soleus muscle.</text>

		<passage>
			<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
			<offset>70</offset>
			<text>The pattern of organogenesis of the aneural soleus muscle of the 129ReJ mouse [rendered aneural by laser ablation of the lumbosacral spinal cord at 14 days in utero (during the period of primary myotube formation, but prior to the formation of secondary myotubes)] was evaluated quantitatively with spaced, serial ultrathin sections and computer-assisted morphometric analysis. Aneural muscles from 16- and 18-day gestation and newborn mice were analyzed to determine age-related changes in a number of parameters including: muscles' maximal girths, numbers of myotubes, myotube diameter distributions, and cluster frequency. Data were compared with a similar study of the organogenesis of the normal soleus muscle (Ontell et al: Am J Anat 181:279-288, 1988). Basic patterns of morphogenesis of the soleus muscle were unchanged by spinal cord ablation, and differences in development between the aneural and innervated muscles were quantitative rather than qualitative. At birth, the aneural muscle contained approximately 76% of the myotubes found in the innervated muscle (approximately 840 myotubes in the innervated muscle and approximately 640 in the aneural muscle). Evidence is presented consistent with the hypothesis that primary myotube formation is reduced by approximately 32% in the aneural muscles and that while extensive secondary myotube formation occurs (approximately 78% of the myotube present at birth in these muscles are secondary myotubes), there is a significant reduction in the number of secondary myotubes in aneural muscles. It is suggested that the reduced numbers of secondary myotubes may be related to the reduction in the number of primary myotubes, which are known to act as scaffolds for secondary myotube formation. The time course of secondary myotube formation and of cluster formation and cluster dispersal and the number of cells per cluster are similar in age-matched, innervated and aneural muscles. The absence of innervation has little effect on myotube growth until birth, when comparison of the myotube diameter distributions reveals a slight alteration in myotube diameter distributions of aneural as compared with innervated muscles.</text>

			<offset>135</offset>
			<text>Regeneration of the sciatic nerve in transplanted nerve grafts in which laminin was inactivated was examined electron microscopically. Nerve grafts for transplantation were obtained from close cloned donor Wistar rats; 1-cm nerve segments of the sciatic nerve were frozen and thawed to kill the Schwann cells. Control recipient rats received grafts treated with normal rabbit serum to repair the artificially-made complete defect of the right sciatic nerve, and the experimental group of rats received grafts doubly treated with normal serum and rabbit anti-laminin antiserum. In the control grafts regenerating axons grew almost completely through the inside of the basal lamina scaffolds (92%) and adhered to the structure, while in the anti-laminin antiserum treated grafts the axons were present outside (52%) and inside (48%) the scaffolds simultaneously. In this case, the adhesion of axons to the scaffolds was obscure. Axons were associated with and without Schwann cells both inside and outside the basal lamina scaffolds. No unassociated Schwann cells were observed. The maximal number of axons in a 2 mm portion of the antiserum-treated grafts was approximately 250 axons per 100 x 100 microns square and 520 in the control at 15 days. At 30 days, almost the same number of axons was found at the distal (8 mm) portion of both groups. The growth in the former was delayed for 3 days. These results indicate that regenerating peripheral nerve axons may enter the basal lamina scaffolds and grow well because of the neurotrophic function of laminin present at the inner side of Schwann cell basal lamina.</text>

			<offset>79</offset>
			<text>Nucleotide sequences encoding the four capsid proteins of foot-and-mouth disease virus subtype O2Brescia/1947 have been determined. These and the deduced amino acid sequences were compared with those of a subtype O1 virus strain. The nucleotide sequences differed at 259 positions, causing only 35 amino acid changes. VP4 and VP2 differed by 2.4 and 1.8%, whereas VP1, known as major viral antigen, and VP3 differed by 8% and 5.5%, respectively. The differences occur mainly in protein domains not involved in the formation of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, suggesting that the surfaces of both viruses are more variable than their scaffolds. The O2Brescia sequence has been submitted to the GenBank data base and has the accession number M 55287.</text>

			<text>1,4-Piperazine and 4-hydroxyproline, two small cyclic polyfunctional systems with defined stereochemistry, were introduced as "molecular scaffolds." We define a "bioactive topology," which is a derived putative low-energy conformation obtained through theoretical conformational analysis of substance P. Substitution of these molecular scaffolds by pharmacophors characteristic of the bioactive topology of the C-terminal hexapeptide of substance P resulted in active, partially nonpeptidal substance P mimetic agonists. The study discusses the concepts and tools used to achieve this structural transformation, and points out the need to address flexibility-rigidity issues in an attempt to maintain sufficient molecular plasticity.</text>

			<offset>133</offset>
			<text>An effective paradigm for transplanting large numbers of neural stem cells after central nervous system (CNS) injury has yet to be established. Biomaterial scaffolds have shown promise in cell transplantation and in regenerative medicine, but improved scaffolds are needed. In this study we designed and optimized multifunctional and biocompatible chitosan-based films and microspheres for the delivery of neural stem cells and growth factors for CNS injuries. The chitosan microspheres were fabricated by coaxial airflow techniques, with the sphere size controlled by varying the syringe needle gauge and the airflow rate. When applying a coaxial airflow at 30 standard cubic feet per hour, ∼300μm diameter spheres were reproducibly generated that were physically stable yet susceptible to enzymatic degradation. Heparin was covalently crosslinked to the chitosan scaffolds using genipin, which bound fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) with high affinity while retaining its biological activity. At 1μgml(-1) approximately 80% of the FGF-2 bound to the scaffold. A neural stem cell line, GFP+RG3.6 derived from embryonic rat cortex, was used to evaluate cytocompatibility, attachment and survival on the crosslinked chitosan-heparin complex surfaces. The MTT assay and microscopic analysis revealed that the scaffold containing tethered FGF-2 was superior in sustaining survival and growth of neural stem cells compared to standard culture conditions. Altogether, our results demonstrate that this multifunctional scaffold possesses good cytocompatibility and can be used as a growth factor delivery vehicle while supporting neural stem cell attachment and survival.</text>

			<text>Adrenomedullin delivery in microsphere-scaffold composite for remodeling of the alveolar bone following tooth extraction: an experimental study in the rat.</text>
		</passage>
		<passage>
			<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
			<offset>155</offset>
			<text>BACKGROUND: Alveolar ridge resorption, as a significant problem in implant and restorative dentistry, has long been considered as an inevitable outcome following tooth extraction. Recently, adrenomedullin (ADM) is reported to be able to stimulate the proliferation and migration of various cells including osteoblasts. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of local ADM application in the tooth extraction socket in vivo. METHODS: Chitosan micropheres were developed by an emulsion-ionic cross-linking method for ADM delivery. Poly (L -lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) and nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) were used to prepare scaffolds to contain the micrspheres with ADM. In vivo experiment was evaluated by transplanting the composite into the rat socket right after the incisor extraction. After 4, 8, 12 weeks implantation, radiographic and histological tests were carried out to evaluate the effect of released ADM on the alveolar bone. RESULTS: The microspheres had a spherical structure and a relative rough and uniform surface, and the particle size was under a normal distribution, with the average diameter of 38.59 μm. The scaffolds had open and interconnected pores. In addition, the high porosity of the composite was 88.93%. Radiographic and histological examination revealed that the PLGA/nHA/CMs/ADM composite could accelerate the alveolar bone remodeling and reduce the residual ridge resorption compared with the PLGA/nHA/CMs scaffold. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that local application of ADM has the potential to preserve the residual alveolar ridge and accelerate the alveolar bone remodeling.</text>

		</passage>
		<passage>
			<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
			<offset>149</offset>
			<text>Biphasic calcium phosphate scaffolds have attracted interest because they have good osteoconductivity and a resorption rate close to that of new bone ingrowth, but their brittleness limits their potential applications. In this study, we show how the infiltration of biphasic calcium phosphate scaffolds with poly(ε-caprolactone) improves their mechanical properties. It was found that the polymer effectively contributes to energy to failure enhancement in bending, compressive and tensile tests. The main toughening mechanism in these composites is crack bridging by polymer fibrils. The presence of fibrils at two different size scales--as found in scaffolds with a bimodal pore distribution--results in a more effective toughening effect as compared to scaffolds with a monomodal pore size distribution, especially in the early stage of mechanical deformation. An optimized infiltration process allowed the preservation of micropore interconnection after infiltration, which is beneficial for cells adhesion. In addition, it is shown that biphasic calcium phosphates infiltrated with poly(ε-caprolactone) are cytocompatible with human bone marrow stromal cells, which makes them good candidates for bone substitution.</text>

			<offset>118</offset>
			<text>Poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) is a biodegradable and biocompatible elastomer specifically developed for soft tissue engineering. Vascular cells adhered to an elastomer may exhibit more physiological behavior because the substrate's mechanical properties more closely match those of the tissue. To investigate the feasibility of using PGS as a scaffold material for vascular tissue engineering, the authors examined the adhesion, proliferation, and phenotypic and morphologic properties of primary baboon endothelial progenitor cells (BaEPCs) and baboon smooth muscle cells (BaSMCs) cultured on PGS films and scaffolds. Tissue culture-treated polystyrene plates were used as controls. Phase contrast microscopy indicated that both types of cells showed normal morphology on PGS films. Immuofluorescent staining revealed that von Willebrand factor and alpha-smooth muscle actin were expressed by BaEPCs and BaSMCs, respectively. Both types of cells proliferated well on PGS surfaces. When cultured in PGS scaffolds, BaSMCs were distributed throughout the scaffolds and synthesized extracellular matrix, as indicated by histological evaluations. The distribution of the BaSMCs in the constructs was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Immunofluorescent staining of cocultured constructs indicated that the BaSMC-seeded constructs provided suitable surfaces for BaEPC adhesion, and both types of cells maintained their specific phenotypes. These results suggest that PGS is an appropriate scaffold material for blood vessel tissue engineering.</text>

			<text>Murine tissue-engineered stomach demonstrates epithelial differentiation.</text>

		<passage>
			<infon key="type">abstract</infon>
			<offset>73</offset>
			<text>BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer remains the second largest cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Postgastrectomy morbidity is considerable and quality of life is poor. Tissue-engineered stomach is a potential replacement solution to restore adequate food reservoir and gastric physiology. In this study, we performed a detailed investigation of the development of tissue-engineered stomach in a mouse model, specifically evaluating epithelial differentiation, proliferation, and the presence of putative stem cell markers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Organoid units were isolated from &lt;3 wk-old mouse glandular stomach and seeded onto biodegradable scaffolds. The constructs were implanted into the omentum of adult mice. Implants were harvested at designated time points and analyzed with histology and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Tissue-engineered stomach grows as an expanding sphere with a simple columnar epithelium organized into gastric glands and an adjacent muscularis. The regenerated gastric epithelium demonstrates differentiation of all four cell types: mucous, enteroendocrine, chief, and parietal cells. Tissue-engineered stomach epithelium proliferates at a rate comparable to native glandular stomach and expresses two putative stem cell markers: DCAMKL-1 and Lgr5. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the successful generation of tissue-engineered stomach in a mouse model for the first time. Regenerated gastric epithelium is able to appropriately proliferate and differentiate. The generation of murine tissue-engineered stomach is a necessary advance as it provides the transgenic tools required to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms of this regenerative process. Delineating the mechanism of how tissue-engineered stomach develops in vivo is an important precursor to its use as a human stomach replacement therapy.</text>

			<text>It is well known that pore design is an important determinant of both the quantity and distribution of regenerated bone in artificial bone tissue scaffolds. A requisite feature is that scaffolds must contain pore interconnections on the order of 100-1000 μm (termed macroporosity). Within this range, there is not a definitive optimal interconnection size. Recent results suggest that pore interconnections permeating the scaffold build material on the order of 2-20 μm (termed microporosity) drive bone growth into the macropore space at a faster rate and also provide a new space for bone growth, proliferating throughout the interconnected microporous network. The effects of microstructural features on bone growth has yet to be fully understood. This work presents the manufacture and characterization of novel combinatorial test scaffolds, scaffolds that test multiple microporosity and macroporosity designs within a single scaffold. Scaffolds such as this can efficiently evaluate multiple mechanical designs, with the advantage of having the designs colocated within a single defect site and therefore less susceptible to experimental variation. This paper provides the manufacturing platform, manufacturing control method, and demonstrates the manufacturing capabilities with three representative scaffolds.</text>

			<text>Assessment of silk fibroin for the repair of buccal mucosa in a rat model.</text>

			<text>This study evaluated the effectiveness of silk fibroin materials for wound repair confined to the buccal mucosa in a rat model by assessing several key clinical parameters and the associated local and systemic immune response. Ninety male SD rats were subjected to microscopic oral surgery to establish a full thickness wound on the buccal mucosa. Rats were randomly divided into three groups based on the treatments received: group A, covered with polyporous silk fibroin scaffold; group B, repaired with crosslinking silk fibroin film; and group C, control. Visual observation of the wounds suggests that wound shrinkage 5 days after the operation was significantly lower in both silk fibroin repaired groups (A and B) than that in the controls. The distribution of inflammatory neutrophils in group A was significantly lower than those in the control group throughout the entire study. The percentage of fibroblasts and capillary endothelia (CD34(+)), and the subgroups of peripheral lymphocytes (CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+)) were similar amongst the groups. The results revealed that placement of silk fibroin in an oral buccal defect can reduce the degree of wound shrinkage and enhance the growth of mucosal epithelial cells without any local or systemic immunological incompatibility.</text>

			<text>General solution to the synthesis of N-2-substituted 1,2,3-triazoles.</text>

			<text>The regioselective N-alkylation of 1,2,3-triazoles 1-6 was studied. Good to excellent N-2 selectivity and high chemical yields for N-2-substituted 4,5-dibromotriazoles 7 were obtained with 4,5-dibromo- and 4-bromo-5-trimethylsilyl-1,2,3-triazoles. These building blocks can be readily converted to 2-mono-, 2,4-di-, and 2,4,5-polysubstituted triazoles 10-15, providing a general, protective, group-free method for the synthesis of N-2-substituted triazoles. Observed regioselectivities can be rationalized by a combination of Frontier Molecular Orbital, steric, and electrostatic directing effects on the heterocyclic scaffolds.</text>

			<text>Effects of iron oxide incorporation for long term cell tracking on MSC differentiation in vitro and in vivo.</text>

			<text>Successful cell therapy will depend on the ability to monitor transplanted cells. With cell labeling, it is important to demonstrate efficient long term labeling without deleterious effects on cell phenotype and differentiation capacity. We demonstrate long term (7 weeks) retention of superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (SPIO) by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vivo, detectable by MRI. In vitro, multilineage differentiation (osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic) was demonstrated by histological evaluation and molecular analysis in SPIO labeled and unlabeled cells. Gene expression levels were comaparable to unlabeled controls in adipogenic and chondrogenic conditions however not in the osteogenic condition. MSCs seeded into a scaffold for 21 days and implanted subcutaneously into nude mice for 4 weeks, showed profoundly altered phenotypes in SPIO labeled samples compared to implanted unlabeled control scaffolds, indicating chondrogenic differentiation. This study demonstrates long term MSC traceability using SPIO and MRI, uninhibited multilineage MSC differentiation following SPIO labeling, though with subtle but significant phenotypical alterations.</text>

			<text>Tissue-engineered blood vessels: alternative to autologous grafts?</text>

			<offset>66</offset>
			<text>Although vascular bypass grafting remains the mainstay for revascularization for ischemic heart disease and peripheral vascular disease, many patients do not have healthy vessels suitable for harvest. Thus, prosthetic grafts made of synthetic polymers were developed, but their use is limited to high-flow/low-resistance conditions because of poor elasticity, low compliance, and thrombogenicity of their synthetic surfaces. To fill this need, several laboratories have produced in vivo or in vitro tissue-engineered blood vessels using molds or prosthetic or biodegradable scaffolds, but each artificial graft has significant problems. Recently, conduits have been grown in the peritoneal cavity of the same animals in which they will be grafted, ensuring no rejection, in the short time of 2 to 3 weeks. Remodeling occurs after grafting such that the tissue is almost indistinguishable from native vessels. This conduit is derived from cells of bone marrow origin, opening new possibilities in vascular modeling and remodeling.</text>
